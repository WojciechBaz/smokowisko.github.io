      <h2>The Foundation and Mission of Smokowisko National Dragon Park</h2>

      <p>
        Smokowisko National Dragon Park was founded in <strong>1893</strong> by a coalition of naturalists,
        folklorists, and local guardians who sought to protect a dwindling population of
        Polish Forest Dragons and the unique ecosystem that shelters them. The decision to
        establish a protected area was prompted by two converging forces of the late 19th century:
        accelerating industrial forestry in the foothills and a wave of interest in documenting
        living European folklore. Early caretakers recorded nesting sites, mapped feeding glades,
        and negotiated seasonal forest quiet hours with nearby communities—customs that became the
        backbone of the Park’s management traditions.
      </p>

      <p>
        In its <em>early years (1893–1914)</em>, Smokowisko operated informally, guided by local statutes
        and civic patronage. Rangers traveled on foot between scattered shelters, sharing hand‑written
        ledgers of observations. A small research hut—later known as the <em>Green Lantern Station</em>—hosted
        the first longitudinal field notes on migration corridors and molting cycles. Although modest in
        resources, the Park pioneered practices that today would be called community science, inviting
        shepherds, herbalists, and woodcutters to contribute sightings and weather logs.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Park’s <em>formalization in the interwar period</em> brought the first comprehensive charter and
        a clear legal mandate for habitat protection, quiet zones, and scientific study. During this time
        a ring of buffer groves was purchased or donated to limit disturbance near roosting crags. The
        charter also codified the role of the <em>Smokowisko Custodians</em>—a council of local representatives
        and scholars charged with balancing conservation with cultural heritage. These measures stabilized
        breeding success and allowed the dragon population to recover from its 19th‑century low.
      </p>

      <p>
        After mid‑century, the Park broadened its mission to include <strong>education</strong> and <strong>research</strong>
        accessible to visitors. Forest classrooms and traveling exhibits introduced generations of students
        to the region’s geology, hydrology, and biodiversity. Partnerships with universities strengthened
        monitoring efforts, while careful zoning preserved dark‑sky corridors for nocturnal flight and
        minimized light spill from nearby valleys.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today, Smokowisko National Dragon Park remains dedicated to three pillars: <strong>protection of habitat</strong>,
        <strong>long‑term research</strong>, and <strong>public stewardship</strong>. Conservation work focuses on maintaining
        old‑growth stands, restoring wetlands that support prey species, and safeguarding thermal updraft
        routes used during seasonal movements. Research priorities include population genetics, nesting
        site fidelity, and the interplay between microclimate and scale iridescence. Through guided talks,
        open archives, and volunteer days, the Park invites visitors and neighbors alike to participate in
        a living tradition of care that began with the founders’ vow in 1893.

        “Let these forests be held in trust for the creatures who make them their home, and for those who
        would learn from their quiet.” — Inscription from the 1893 Smokowisko charter
