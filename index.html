      <h2>The Foundation and Mission of Smokowisko National Dragon Park</h2>
      <p>
        Smokowisko National Dragon Park was founded in <strong>1893</strong> by a coalition of naturalists,
        folklorists, and local guardians. Among its notable patrons were Count Janusz Radziwiłł, a respected
        statesman and patron of the sciences; Professor Helena Modrzewska, an early zoologist from Kraków
        University; and Captain Władysław Brzeziński, a retired cavalry officer known for his deep knowledge
        of Poland’s wilderness. These historical figures combined their influence, expertise, and resources
        to ensure the park’s creation and legal protection.
      </p>
      <p>
        The founders acted in response to accelerating industrial forestry in the foothills and the
        growing urgency to preserve the last breeding populations of Polish Forest Dragons. Early caretakers
        documented nesting sites, mapped feeding glades, and negotiated seasonal forest quiet hours with
        local villages—customs that became the backbone of the Park’s management traditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        In its <em>early years (1893–1914)</em>, the park operated informally under local statutes and civic
        patronage. Rangers traveled on foot between scattered shelters, often guided by oral reports from
        hunters and herbalists. The now-legendary <em>Green Lantern Station</em> hosted the first longitudinal
        field notes on dragon migration corridors and molting cycles.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Park’s <em>formalization in the interwar period</em> brought the first comprehensive charter and
        a clear legal mandate for habitat protection. This included the creation of a ring of buffer groves
        to reduce disturbance near roosting crags and the establishment of the <em>Smokowisko Custodians</em>—a
        council balancing conservation with cultural heritage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, only certain designated areas of the park are open to tourists. Visitors may explore safe
        observation points, guided trails, and educational exhibits. For safety and conservation reasons,
        the core forest is off-limits to the public due to the potential of encountering wild dragons.
        Only trained park rangers may enter these protected areas. Nonetheless, many visitors report
        thrilling glimpses of dragons flying overhead or moving through the trees.
      </p>
      <p>
        The current dedicated staff includes Head Ranger Piotr Kowalski, Conservation Biologist Dr. Marta
        Zielińska, Education Coordinator Aneta Nowak, and Senior Caretaker Tomasz Wróbel. Together, they
        carry forward the founders’ mission of habitat protection, research, and public stewardship.

      <h3>Founders’ Note (Excerpt)</h3>
      <p>
        “Let these forests be held in trust for the creatures who make them their home, and for those who
        would learn from their quiet.” — Inscription from the 1893 Smokowisko charter
